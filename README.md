### About Me

I am an undergraduate student at the School of Physics, Peking University, with a strong passion for research in condensed matter physics. My academic interests encompass a wide range of topics, including quantum mechanics, many-body physics, computational physics, and the application of advanced mathematical techniques to solve complex physical problems.

### Current Goals

I am currently preparing for graduate studies and applying for a PhD position to further deepen my expertise in these areas. I am particularly keen on expanding my knowledge of theoretical frameworks in condensed matter physics, such as **topology**, **magnetism**, and **superconductivity**. Additionally, I am interested in computational methods for investigating these phenomena, including **Exact Diagonalization**, **Density Matrix Renormalization Group (DMRG) Techniques** and **Monte Carlo Approaches**


### Other Interests

Beyond my primary focus in physics, I am also an amateur enthusiast of:

- **Game Theory**
- **Information Digging and Processing**
